# CreditCardFraudProject Description

Buisness problem: The problem I will be trying to tackle is dealing with credit card fraud. There are enormous amounts of transactions passed each day, and it is important that our model can respond quickly and accuratly to ensure the safety and security of our customers. However many challenges come with creating the model. The dataset will be massive, and with that most of the transactions within the dataset will be non fraudulent. In fact in my exploratory data analysis I found that there were 249,243 non fraudulent cases compared to 456 fraudulent cases. In order to help prove accuracy for imbalanced data we will have to pay more attention to our recall score, rather than overall accuracy. In addition, to protect the privacy of the customers PCA was done ahead of time in order to keep the data secure. 

Plan of attack: In order to tackle this problem, we will first visualize and inspect the dataset, as well as look at any possible correlations within the dataset. We will also make sure that the dataset is cleaned and that no data is missing. We will then focus on model testing and making sure we have the best parameters necessaary for the most accurate version of our model.
